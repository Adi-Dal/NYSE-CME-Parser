# NYSE-CME-Parser
NYSE/CME parsers built in C++. Version 2 utilizes multithreading to parse various formats concurrently decrease parse times. NYSE Parsers follow Chicago(now Austin) specifications. CME specifications can be found on their website but need an account to get the ir files if you want to use the inbuilt functions to help parse.
